# Project-Dr.Semmelweis

In this, I have analyzed the medical data collected by Dr.Semmelweis who discovered the importance of handwashing in 1847.

Dr.Simmelweis realized that about 10% of the women in Vienna General Hospital die just after giving birth, due to childbed fever. He found that the increasing number of deaths is due to the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the child. And thus he wanted handwashing as a strict thing to be followed.
